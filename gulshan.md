# lscpu command
A command-line utility “lscpu” in Linux is used to get CPU information of the system. The “lscpu” command fetches the CPU architecture information from the “sysfs” and /proc/cpuinfo files and displays it in a terminal.
# architecture
The architecture of a computer system is the user-visible interface. The architecture is the structure and the operation of the system as seen by the programmer. Implementation is the construction of that interface and structure from specific hardware and possibly software components.
# CPU modes
CPU modes (also called processor modes, CPU states, CPU privilege levels and other names) are operating modes for the central processing unit of some computer architectures that place restrictions on the type and scope of operations that can be performed by certain processes being run by the CPU.
# Byte Order
The order of numbers in a computer word. Byte order refers to the order of digits in computer words at least 16 bits long. See word. Big Endian and Little Endian. Big endian is how we normally deal with numbers: the most significant byte or digits are placed leftmost in the structure
# Address sizes
Data bus size, instruction size, address size are usually multiples of the word size. Just to confuse matters, for backwards compatibility, Microsoft Windows API defines a WORD as being 16 bits, a DWORD as 32 bits and a QWORD as 64 bits, regardless of the processor.
# Thread
A thread is a single sequential flow of control within a program. The real excitement surrounding threads is not about a single sequential thread. Rather, it's about the use of multiple threads running at the same time and performing different tasks in a single program.
# Core
In summary, a core is a small CPU or processor built into a big CPU or CPU socket. It can independently perform or process all computational tasks. From this perspective, we can consider a core to be a smaller CPU or a smaller processor within a big processor.
# Socket
A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.
# NUMA node
NUMA is an alternative approach that links several small, cost-effective nodes using a high-performance connection. Each node contains processors and memory, much like a small SMP system. However, an advanced memory controller allows a node to use memory on all other nodes, creating a single system image.
# Vendor id
Alternatively referred to as a VID, a vendor ID is a unique number assigned to each piece of computer hardware. The vendor ID helps a computer identify the hardware being installed in the computer. Most vendor IDs start with 0x, like 0x9710 or 9710. Other vendor IDs may be the first few letters of the company's name or an abbreviation.
# Cpu family
A family is a group of products that have similarities, are compatible, or made by the same manufacturer. For example, the Intel Pentium II computer processors are in the same family of processors, as they have similar instructions and are compatible.
# Virtualization
Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system. This enables IT organizations to run more than one virtual system – and multiple operating systems and applications – on a single server. The resulting benefits include economies of scale and greater efficiency.
# Cache
Is hardware or software that is used to store something, usually data, temporarily in a computing environment. It is a small amount of faster, more expensive memory used to improve the performance of recently or frequently accessed data.
